Login Page UI

This is a small login page I made while learning HTML and CSS. I struggled with making the background responsive and keeping the layout stable on different screen sizes. Some parts of the design still break because I’m a beginner and learning as I go. I’m uploading this project to track my progress, and I’d appreciate any suggestions or tips to help me improve the code and design.
